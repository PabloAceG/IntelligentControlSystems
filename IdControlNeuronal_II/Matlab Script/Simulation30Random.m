% e) Do N=30 simulations of the controler providing random values for refx 
% and refy using a loop, which is inside an enviroment of 10x10 metes.
% For each simulation, time for inputs and outputs must be saved.
% Generated an "input" matrix with 2xN size, where E_d and E_theta values
% are acumulated. In the same way, an "output" matrix where variable V and
% W are acumulated must be also generated.

% Generating N random positions, simulating and saving them into variables
N = 30

    % rand generates random numbers between 0 and 1, as we have an
    % eviroment of 10 x 10 meters, we just have to multiple the number 
    refx = 10 * rand;
    refy = 10 * rand;
