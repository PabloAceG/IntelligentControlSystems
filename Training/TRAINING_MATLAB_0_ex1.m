%EXERCISE 1:  MATRICES AND VECTORS
% 1. Define matrix A and vector v:
% A can be also define as: [1,2;3,4;5,6;7,8];
A = [1  2
    3   4
    5   6   
    7   8
    ];
% v can be define as the same way as A or:
v_h = [14 : 2 : 20]; 
v = v_h';

% 2. Obtain and display B as a concatenation of A and v 
B = [A v]

% 3. Obtain and display a row vector, which is the result of the concat. 
% of the rows of B

vrow = B.';       % Transpose matrix.
vrow = vrow (:).' % It is obtained the transpose of the concatenation of
                  % the columns and rows.
                  % The : simbol specifies all the rows and columns in a 
                  % matrix.

% 4. Obtain and display a column vector, which is the result of the concat.
% of the columns of B

vcol = B (:)
